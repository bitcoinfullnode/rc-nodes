This release removes compatibility with peers older than version 1.5, and no
longer accepts connections from them.

Conditional logic dependent on block 445000 has been removed where no longer
necessary, as block 445000 has been passed now.

Parallel blockchain download using 36-block segments is now the default
regardless of height. Returning more than 36 blocks at a time by getNextBlocks
is no longer supported.

The maximum WebSockets message size and the maximum allowed response size to a
getNextBlocks request have been reduced from 192 MB to 10 MB.

A checksum at block 445000 has been added.

Added isDownload field to the getBlockchainStatus and getState API response,
indicating if blockchain download is in progress. This gets set to true when
a batch of more than 10 blocks at once has been downloaded from a peer, and
gets reset to false when an attempt to download more blocks from a peer does
not result in any new blocks added.

The peer requests getUnconfirmedTransactions, getMilestoneBlockIds,
getNextBlockIds, getNextBlocks, processBlock, processTransactions,
getCumulativeDifficulty, are being rejected while a blockchain download is in
progress, as indicated by the above isDownloading property.

The timestamp of the last connect attempt to a peer is now included in the peer
JSON object.

Added a connect parameter to DumpPeers debug API, to force a connection attempt
to each known peer first, adminPassword required if needed.

The run.bat script on Windows no longer uses the -server flag by default.

Updating nodes of version older than 1.5 to this release will delete blocks
after height 445000, to make sure such nodes are not left permanently stranded
on the 1.4 fork.
