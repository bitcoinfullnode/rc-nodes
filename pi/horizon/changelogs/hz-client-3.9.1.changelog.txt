This is a critical bugfix release. Everyone is required to update.

It fixes the validation of asset exchange order cancellations. 
The missing validation can be exploited by an attacker. The bug could be used to transfer 
coins of a foreign bid order at the cost of own unconfirmed balance. Furthermore leads the attack to a DOS. 

Mac OS X run command 'mac-osx-run.command' added.
