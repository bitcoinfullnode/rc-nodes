This release is a mandatory upgrade! It introduces a lot of new features, and makes a hard fork necessary at the block height of 515000.

This release requires Java 8 and will not compile nor run with Java 7.

The database upgrade from v4.0e may take up to 3 hours.
Upgrades from HZ v3.8.x and HZ v3.9.x are also supported, but the database will be emptied.

The fastest way (about 5 minutes - depending on download bandwidth) to upgrade to  
Horizon version v5.2 is to download the database files, instead of upgrading or starting from scratch with an empty database.
Database files can be found here:

Horizon code changes:
Horizon UPnP replaced with new Nxt UPnP code
WebSockets are disabled by default
GUI login with account alias

After hard fork guaranteed balance confirmations need 1440 blocks instead of 40 blocks

Checkpoints updated
