Sometimes a transaction got not included in a block because of to many NHZ V3.2 nodes in peers list. 
Now NHZ v3.2 nodes are blacklisted. They are already on a own fork since block 275000.

Peers updated and new pool peer addresses added to wellKnownPeers. The pool addresses are updated daily 
to provide a daily fresh list of peers.

Checkpoint checks during blockchain download added. Every 720th block is checked. Checkpoints are hard coded blockId checks. 
Only blockIds and heights in the blockchain up to the time of the release are recognized. Disable it by setting nhz.useCheckpoints to false.

GUI bug fixes:
* Sometimes mainnet got recognized as testnet.
* There were file encoding problems for some language
* Asset exchange buy/sell input fields were always visible
* Modals opened with full list of features (advanced mode) instead to open in basic mode.
* Sometimes buttons were overlapping
