This is a experimental release. An upgrade is not mandatory, but recommended.

This release is the first release which stores all objects in the h2 database.
On a normal VPS the database upgrade can take up to 2.5 hours.

The fastest way (about 5 minutes, depends on download bandwidth) to upgrade to  
hz-v4.0e is to download the database, instead of upgrading or starting from scratch 
with an empty database.
