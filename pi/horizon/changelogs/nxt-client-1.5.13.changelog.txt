Fixed Token validation to check whether the public key matches the one
announced in the blockchain for the same account.

Added compact.sh/compact.bat scripts to compact the database, resulting in
smaller size and possibly better performance. Those should only be run when
the Nxt server is not running.

API improvements:

getAllPrunableMessages, getAssetTransfers, getBlocks, getCurrencyTransfers,
getPolls, getPrunableMessages now allow filtering by block timestamp.

Many APIs now support requireBlock and requireLastBlock optional parameters.
If either of those is specified, it is guaranteed that the specified block is
present in the blockchain, or the specified last block is the current last
block, and the blockchain state does not change, while the API request is
being executed. An error is returned otherwise.

Added getExpectedAskOrders, getExpectedBidOrders, getExpectedAssetTransfers,
getExpectedBuyOffers, getExpectedSellOffers, getExpectedCurrencyTransfers,
getExpectedExchangeRequests, getExpectedOrderCancellations.
Those return the corresponding orders, transfers, or offers, that are expected
to be executed in the next blocks, based on the current content of the
unconfirmed transactions pool, and the phased transactions planned to finish
in the next block, in the order in which they are expected to be executed.
It is not guaranteed that the next block will indeed contain exactly those
transactions and in the same order, as this is up to the block forger.
It is also not possible to know in advance if the phased transactions expected
to finish in the next block will be approved or rejected.

getAccountExchangeRequests now excludes the phased exchange requests that have
not yet finished, or have not been approved, and the timestamp field now
contains the block timestamp of the block in which the exchange request was
executed, rather than the transaction timestamp.

getPollVotes and getPollVote now accept includeWeights parameter, default
false, to calculate and display the weight assigned to each vote in the poll
results.

Added Hash API, for calculating the hash of a secret using any of the
supported hash functions, which can be used for deriving the hash in by-hash
phasing. See getConstants for the list of supported hash functions.

For running over tor, or other socks proxy, the socksProxyHost and
socksProxyPort parameters can now be specified in the nxt.properties file
instead of having to include them in the command line.

Performance improvements, allowing table trimming to be done in parallel with
blockchain download.

Added UPnP support, enabled by default for the peer port and disabled for the
API port, using the nxt.enablePeerUPnP and nxt.enableAPIUPnP properties.

Added a warning on startup if nxt.myAddress is set but does not resolve to any
of the external addresses found, including those discovered using UPnP.

More links to the wiki tutorials in the help menu.

System tray status dialog now refreshes every second when visible.

Client UI:

The asset exchange page now displays unconfirmed orders as well as phased 
orders that are expected to be executed in the next block.

The monetary system page now displays unconfirmed exchange requests and offers
as well as phased requests and offers that are expected to be executed in the 
next block.

Phasing modals "None", "By Transaction" and "By Hash" were implemented as part
of the advanced section of transaction modals.

Calculate hash modal is now available in the settings menu. Use it to calculate
hash values for "By Hash" phasing model. 

Added "Admin Password" field to the client settings. Set it to the server admin
password to allow the client to automatically determine its forging status when 
connected to a remote node.

Peer modal dialogs now use the admin password specified in the client settings 
as default value.

Forging indicator is displayed in Gray instead of Red when the forging status
cannot be determined by the client when connecting to a remote node without 
specifying a correct admin password.

Forging indicator tooltip, now displays further information about the forging 
status.

Transaction info dialog correctly follows links between matching bid and ask 
orders and links from vote to poll.

Marketplace usage warning and a corresponding, marketplace enablement
setting has been implemented.

This release will perform a rescan on first start.
